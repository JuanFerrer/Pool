Created the next two milestones, added labels and issues and assigned them to each person.
Turn cycle implemented.

### **13 Feb 2017** - Juan

Added ability to hit again (turns?). Found a model to use as the table. Need to get the colliders right, though.

I uploaded the project today. I included a series of empty scripts.

 - UI
 - Menu navigation

Add more as you see fit.
Happy coding! =]
