    <h1>How to commit changes</h1>
    <p>Make sure you have the right branch selected (it usually will <b>not</b> be master, but your dev branch).</p>

    <p>As you can see, a preview of the changes you have made since last update can be seen.</p>

    <p>Add a short summary and a description of the changes you made And click "commit to [branch name]"</p>

    <p>After a short wait, you should see a new ball/checkpoint appear in the timeline. This is the change you've made to your <b>local</b> branch. If you check on GitHub, the changes will not yet show on your branch.</p>

    <p>This is because you need to upload it to the <b>remote</b> branch. It is done by clicking "Sync". I can't say this enough, make sure you have the right branch selected (usually <b>not</b> master, but your dev branch.).</p>
    <img src="./Media/CommitChanges04.jpg" />
    <p>Once you've done that, your changes will be available on your branch for everyone to see.</p>
