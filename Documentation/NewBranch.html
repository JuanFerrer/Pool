    <h1>How to create a new branch</h1>
    <p>Making sure you have the right project selected, click the strangely looking icon next to the branch selector.</p>

    <p>A small menu should appear. Write the name of the new branch and make sure you select the right branch you want to copy (usually master).</p>

    <p>Click "Create new branch". After a moment you should see something like this.</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/JuanFerrer/Pool/tree/master/Documentation/Media/NewBranch03.jpg" />
    <p>This intends to show the point in time where your branch was created. It should show also the differences between your branch and the comparing one (usually you want to compare with master).
    <br />You have now a <b>local</b> branch. Clicking on "Publish" should upload it to GitHub and make it <b>remote</b>.</p>
    <p>After that, you can select the branch you're working on and <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JuanFerrer/Pool/blob/master/Documentation/CommitChanges.html">commit changes</a> to that branch.</p>
